Revolt v0.1

<b>Premise:</b>
Game takes place in a region represented by a grid that shows various areas, each with their 	
own detailed points of interest and stats. The player is leading a resistance against a corrupt 
government, with many things to take into consideration.

<b>Objective:</b>
The primary objective for the player is to overthrow the government which requires several
prerequisites. In order to preform the operation to throw out the government, the player must
control 80%> of the map. In order to control a tile, the player must complete an operation
which is unlocked by having more support than the government in that tile.

<b>Operations:</b>
The primary way of interacting with the game is preforming operations to achieve various
objectives. The most important are Coups, a coup is an operation that will have the
requirement of having more support than the government in the tile a coup is being
performed. Depending on what type of tile it is, there will also be other requirements and
variables involved with it. 

The other important operations are Propagating and Sabotaging.
Propagating will increase support from a tile as long as there is order. Propagating is low
risk overall, but slow, and increases in danger as long as there is government support.
Sabotaging decreases government support, but is much higher risk. It also makes the 
government more likely to retaliate in response. Sabotaging works well in both order and
chaos, and works well while governments support is high.

Incite and suppres.
Inciting a tile will cause the Chaos Factor to increase. Rebel support will increase slightly,
and Government support will drop slightly. It drastically increases Government Threat.
Suppressing a tile does the reverse. Aside from actually increasing Government Threat 	
slightly.

Collection operations allow the player to collect additional resources to allow them to
preform other operations. Collection operations are generally low risk, but are the most
varied. Collection operations are sometimes better in order or chaos depending on what that
specific operation is.

Each operation requires the assignment of an Agent to lead it, and then any other optional
additions to improve chances/change outcome. There is also a cost to start the operation
which will vary from Operation to Operation.

<b>Values:</b>
Each tile has multiple values representing various aspects of the current situation. The two
most obvious ones are the Support Factors. The populace in any given tile will have two
values showing how much they support each of the factions. The initial value is around 75%
for Government support, and 0-10% for Rebel support. These values change by performing
operations, but they also can change the success of an operation. If no action is taken by
either faction for a while, the values will begin to change automatically to a medium
balance.
The secondary tile value is Chaos Factor. This is how unruly the people are. 0% represents
people being completely docile, following every instruction, whereas 100% is full on civil
strife. Operations will usually have lower success rates at either end, and higher around the
middle. However, while chaos factor is near the middle, it is very easy for it to sway.
Government support is much higher while a tile is in Order, and Government threat
increases much more while a tile is in Chaos.
	
Government threat (Still undecided whether this is Resistance value or tile Value)
represents how likely the government is to retaliate. This starts at 0% It is increased by
basically any action the player makes other than laying low. 
The resistance has a Morale value, this starts at around 75%. Morale is lost whenever an
operation is failed and increases when an operation is successful. Morale effects how
successful some operations will be. If the resistance reaches 0% Morale, they give up and
the revolution fails.

<b>Resources:</b>
Money is the most common resource and is used in almost every operation. It is invested at
the start and sometimes has more rewards, or is exchanged for something else. The player
starts with X amount.
Supporters are how many common people you have supporting the revolution. They are
rewarded for certain actions which makes the resistance look good. They are slowly lost
over time if they resistance's progress slows down. 
Weapons can be given to highly increase the chances of a successful operation, however
it also increases government threat, and has small chances to increase Government
support, chaos factor, or decrease rebel support. 
Special items represent individual or rare items that are useful in less operations, but have a
greater effect. Examples include incriminating documents, poison, disguise or speaker set.
Supplies covers both medical supplies, and food. Supplies are slowly consumed overtime.
They can be used to heal agents faster, and in various operations. If supplies run out, then 
morale drops rapidly until supplies are reacquired. 

<b>Agents:</b>
Agents are particularly useful operatives that help you directly with operations. While
supporters represent the general population helping with the revolution, agents represent
leaders, spies, fighters or anyone who is important in leading the rebellion. Agents will
have varying traits that make them suited to different roles, and affect their chances of
success while involved with an operation. If an Agent is injured, then their effectiveness is
reduced until they are healed. If an Agent dies, then they are removed from the game. There
are other roles that Agents can fill that aren't running operations. These roles are
semi-permanent and remain until they are changed. Example, investing resources in a	
particular operation gives the hideout an administration room. When an Agent is assigned
to this room, they will reduce the overall time of an operation dependent on their own
intelligence. Agents can be required in many ways, such as random encounters, operations,	
recruited, bribed.

<b>Hideout:</b>
The hideout is the resistance headquarters. Here the player manages resources, agents, 
current operations, personalization. It basically acts like a menu screen to keep track of 
everything.

<b>Tiles:</b>
Each tile will have various additional bits of information that make a difference to anything
that would effect it. These include terrain, population, notable people, notable buildings etc.
